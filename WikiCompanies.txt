Completing: Retrieve the Wikipedia page for 'List of companies of the United States' using the Wikipedia API.

To create a list of 300 companies from the USA and their websites from Wikipedia, we need to retrieve the Wikipedia page for "List of companies of the United States" using the Wikipedia API.

First, we need to install the Wikipedia API using the pip command:

Python
Copy Code
!pip install wikipedia-api


Next, we need to import the Wikipedia API and create a Wikipedia page object for the "List of companies of the United States":

Python
Copy Code
import wikipediaapi

wiki = wikipediaapi.Wikipedia('en')
page = wiki.page('List of companies of the United States')


We can then extract the text content of the Wikipedia page using the text attribute and parse it to extract the company names and websites. We can use regular expressions to search for patterns in the text to identify company names and website URLs.

Python
Copy Code
import re

text = page.text

# Search for company names
company_names = re.findall(r'^\d+\.\s(.+)\n', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)

# Search for website URLs
website_urls = re.findall(r'(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)', text)

# Combine company names and website URLs into a list of dictionaries
companies = [{'name': name, 'website': website} for name, website in zip(company_names, website_urls)]


Finally, we can select 300 companies from the list of companies we've extracted and return their names and website URLs:

Python
Copy Code
selected_companies = companies[:300]
selected_company_names = [company['name'] for company in selected_companies]
selected_company_websites = [company['website'] for company in selected_companies]
